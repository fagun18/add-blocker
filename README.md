# Fagun Ad Blocker Extension
My Ad Blocker is a Chrome browser extension that blocks ads from appearing on webpages. It is designed to improve the browsing experience by removing unwanted advertising content.

Installation
To install the extension, follow these steps:

Download or clone the repository to your computer.
Open Chrome and navigate to the "Extensions" page (chrome://extensions/).
Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner of the window.
Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you saved the extension files.
The ad blocker extension should now be loaded and active in Chrome.
Usage
Once the extension is installed and enabled, it will automatically block ads from appearing on webpages. The extension will hide all <iframe> and <img> elements on the page by default.

To customize the ad blocking rules, you can modify the background.js file in the extension folder. This file contains the rules that determine which URLs to block.
