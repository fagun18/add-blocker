# Fagun Ad Blocker Extension
My Ad Blocker is a Chrome browser extension that blocks ads from appearing on webpages. It is designed to improve the browsing experience by removing unwanted advertising content.

1. Start by creating a new folder on your computer where you will save the extension files.

2. Inside the new folder, create a file called manifest.json . This code sets up the basic structure of the extension, including its name, version, permissions, background scripts, and content scripts.
3. Create a new file called background.js . This code tells Chrome to block requests to URLs that contain doubleclick.net or googleadservices.com.
4. Create a new file called content.js. This code hides all <iframe> and <img> elements on the page.
5. Save all the files and open Chrome.

6. Click the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner of the browser window, then select "More tools" and "Extensions".

7. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner of the window.

8. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you saved the extension files.

9. The ad blocker extension should now be loaded and active in Chrome.

Note: This is just a basic example of how to create an ad blocker extension. To make a more effective and comprehensive ad blocker, you may need to add more rules to the background.js file and modify the content.js file to target specific ad elements on webpages.





Installation
To install the extension, follow these steps:

Download or clone the repository to your computer.
Open Chrome and navigate to the "Extensions" page (chrome://extensions/).
Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner of the window.
Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you saved the extension files.
The ad blocker extension should now be loaded and active in Chrome.
Usage
Once the extension is installed and enabled, it will automatically block ads from appearing on webpages. The extension will hide all <iframe> and <img> elements on the page by default.

To customize the ad blocking rules, you can modify the background.js file in the extension folder. This file contains the rules that determine which URLs to block.
